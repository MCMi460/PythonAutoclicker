# Hypixel Extension

Why does this exist? - A fair question. I created this because an undisclosed friend knew I was a programmer and wanted a tool for cheating in Hypixel subtly, reliably, and smoothly.

I told him I could do the first one, so here it is. I'm not trying this in case of getting banned, so use it at your own discretion.

*How does it work?*

Simple - the first few clicks it makes when you press the activation key will be slightly slower than the CPS you defined. Once it's up and running, it'll fluctuate by a few milliseconds from your actual target-ed CPS specified. This is to hopefully keep Hypixel from detecting you are inputting exactly x CPS.

Also, it might not work. I didn't bother bug testing this thing; I made this while in class using a pencil and paper.

Don't sue me.

Thanks.
